If you are not familiar with Eureka, it is a framework that helps to build forms in iOS.
To learn more about it you can start by reading
[Introducing Eureka iOS form library written in pure Swift](https://blog.xmartlabs.com/2015/09/29/Introducing-Eureka-iOS-form-library-written-in-pure-Swift/) or visit [Eureka's GitHub page](https://github.com/xmartlabs/Eureka) where you can find all the latest changes.

We are very happy to announce that version 3.0 of Eureka is now available, with some bug fixes like memory leaks and new features that some of you desire a lot.

We will discover the new features that this version includes:
 - Multivalued section
 - Usage of nib file for all rows

## Multivalued section
How many times have you desired to create a section, commonly as the same type and later you need to delete some of them or reorganize? Like a contacts library or a calendar events with different priorities or anything that you can imagine!

The idea of this feature is to allow us to easily create insertable, deletable and re-orderable sections.

#### How to use it?
In order to create a multivalued section we have to use MultivaluedSection type instead of the regular Section type. MultivaluedSection extends Section and has some additional properties to configure multivalued section behavior.

```swift
form +++
    MultivaluedSection(multivaluedOptions: [.Reorder, .Insert, .Delete],
                       header: "Multivalued TextField",
                       footer: ".Insert adds a 'Add Item' (Add New Tag) button row as last cell.") {
        $0.addButtonProvider = { section in
            return ButtonRow(){
                $0.title = "Add New Tag"
            }
        }
        $0.multivaluedRowToInsertAt = { index in
            return NameRow() {
                $0.placeholder = "Tag Name"
            }
        }
        $0 <<< NameRow() {
            $0.placeholder = "Tag Name"
        }
    }
```

Previous code snippet shows how to create a multivalued section. In this case we want to insert, delete and reorder rows as multivaluedOptions argument indicates.

You can find an usage example in the [Eureka project](https://github.com/xmartlabs/Eureka).


## Usage of nib file in all the rows
Before, if we want to make a changed on an existent row, we couldn't.
We have to create a custom row, without taking in count that the changed was so little maybe; like a change of color for example.

The other chance, if the modification was about change fonts colors, we could use the methods **defaultCellUpdate** and **defaultCellSetup** over the type of row and that allows us to set the colors, fonts, aligns, etc.

But what happen when the changes was bigger? When the changes are in the layout (like constraints), we had to create a custom row.

But now; as the demand of the user that need to modify a row without the necessity of create a custom row. We decide to make some changes to allow the usage of a nib file to create your own row style and the way that it is showed.
This is a big change for all the users of Eureka!!

Now you just need to create a nib file and associated to the type of Eureka row it is.
Making the row code more eligible, just you can see the NameRow and no more "MyNameRow" (custom row type).

Of course that sometimes it is not enough to modify an existent row, because are a lot of changes to make on it, so is in that case that we need to create a custom row. If is this your case, you can see some custom rows that already exist [EurekaCommunity]( https://github.com/EurekaCommunity).

#### How to use it?
In some few steps you can add some custom UI components that you need in an existent row. For example... imagine that you want to use an existent Eureka row, but you want to have some extra components. All you need to do is follow this steps:
 - Create a nib file
 - Add all the UI components that you need
 - Connect the outlets to your cell class
 - Convert you cell class as a subclass of the NameRow (ex: EmailRow)

 Everything is done! You have a raw with all that Eureka can gives you and all the extra components that you desire, without having to create a new custom row.


## Where to go from here
We hope that this features, make the usage of this library more enjoyable and more productive!
